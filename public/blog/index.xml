      <description>David HeinIntroductionThis project explores the interaction of several different variables related to the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States. There were four different data sets combined. The data sets for opioid prescription rates per 100 people and drug overdose deaths per 100,000 people on a county level in 2016 were taken from the CDC. The data sets for median household income on a county level and percentage of adults lacking a high school diploma on a county level in 2016 were taken from the US Census Bureau.</description>
