There were four different data sets combined. The data sets for opioid prescription rates per 100 people and drug ovdeaths per 100,000 people on a county level in 2016 were taken from the CDC. The data sets for median household income on a county level and percentage of adults lacking a high school diploma on a county level in 2016 were taken from the US Census Bureau.</description>
